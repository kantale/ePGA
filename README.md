# ePGA

Working installation: [http://www.epga.gr/](http://www.epga.gr/)


ePGA is comprised by two different services: Explore and Translate.

Explore:
* Receive personalized recommendations based on gene-drug-phenotype associations.
* Browse the state of the art pharmacogenomics knowledge on gene-drug-phenotype associations.

Translate:
* Upload individual genotypes and receive a report on their phenotypes for all known pharmacogenes.
* Browse pharmacogenomics summary data on a set of genotypes.

These are two independent web services, although in order to get full functionality both should be running.
